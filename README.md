# TITANIC-DATA-ANALYSIS
🚢 Titanic Survivor Prediction – Data Analytics &amp; Machine Learning Project 🐍  This project is a hands-on implementation of data analytics and machine learning concepts using the legendary Sinking of the RMS Titanic dataset.The main objective is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, passenger class, and embarkation point.

📊 Project Overview
